# Convolutional Autoencoder for MNIST dataset latent features clustering

This repo is a test motivated by my [scientific initiation](https://github.com/tremefabris/automata-classification). Its purpose is to evaluate different techniques (initializations, scalers, architectures) for the convolutional autoencoder and understand its consequences in the latent feature clustering.  

Deeply inspired by this article: [Deep Clustering with Convolutional Autoencoders](https://xifengguo.github.io/papers/ICONIP17-DCEC.pdf)
